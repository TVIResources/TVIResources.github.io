Understanding intersection geometry and route shapes is a foundational spatial skill for safe, confident travel. For people who are blind or visually impaired, environments are experienced sequentially and through non-visual cues; that makes it harder to form a clear, global picture of a junction or a multi-leg route from a single walk-through. Simple overhead tactile models translate fleeting spatial layouts into repeatable, touchable references students can explore with their hands.

## Why overhead tactile models help

- Provide a concrete reference for abstract terms (T‑junction, roundabout, skewed intersection).
- It is easy to forget that some students that are blind have never seen an intersection; tactile models make the shapes and relationships explicit. Also, they may not have experience with the actual print letters we name the junctions after (T, Y, X, etc.).
- Reduce cognitive load by offering a stable schema students can use when planning or rehearsing travel sequences.
- Support rehearsal of approach→pause→cross→reorient sequences in a safe classroom setting.
- Improve transfer to real-world navigation by matching tactile features to on-street cues (curbs, medians, crosswalks, landmarks).

## What students gain

- Practice sequencing and alignment strategies that support independent travel.
- Better hazard anticipation and decision-making at intersections.
- Faster acquisition of wayfinding language and mental maps.

## Materials & simple builds

You don't need expensive equipment. Classroom-friendly options include foam board, craft foam, cardstock, wooden dowels, and simple 3D‑printed curb overlays. Best practices:

- Keep models overhead (plan view) with raised elements for curbs, medians, and crosswalks.
- Use distinct tactile textures for different features and add braille/large-print labels where helpful.
- Build modular pieces (nodes and legs) so instructors can assemble a variety of intersections and routes quickly.

If you have access to a 3D printer, small STL templates for common junctions (T, four‑way, roundabout) let you produce repeatable parts; otherwise, low-cost craft materials create very effective prototypes.

## Classroom activities

- Paired exploration: one student feels the model while a partner gives directions — then swap roles.
- Route rehearsal: plan an approach and crossing, act it out, and reflect on decision points.
- Variation drills: change one element (offset crosswalk, added median) and ask students how their plan changes.
- Build-and-explain: students design a small model and describe how they'd navigate it.

## Teaching tips

- Introduce one shape at a time and follow with a short on-street comparison so students connect tactile features to real cues.
- Use consistent vocabulary (approach leg, node, median) so classroom language maps to tactile features.
- Encourage students to annotate models or keep tactile sketches to reinforce memory.

## Safety, storage, and maintenance

- Make durable parts for high-use elements and keep fragile pieces for demonstration.
- Store modular parts in labeled bins for quick lesson setup.
- Replace or repair worn textures and braille labels to keep touch cues reliable.

## Customization and contribution

These ideas are a starting point. If you develop printable templates, lesson plans, or assessment rubrics, please share them so other instructors can benefit. I can add example STL files and a short lesson plan to this post on request — tell me which junction types or objectives you want prioritized.
