StudentDataGUI is a focused student-management application designed for teachers, TVIs, O&M specialists, and other professionals who support students who are blind or visually impaired. It centralizes per-student records (assessments, session notes, accommodations, braille samples, assistive-technology settings, and attached artifacts) into a simple GUI backed by a local database and portable JSON exports. The interface is organized around individual student folders and timeline entries so you can quickly find historical documents, generate reports, and create backups — all without needing a separate record-keeping system.

In everyday use, an instructor creates or opens a student record, adds dated session entries or assessment scores, and attaches files (lesson plans, braille documents, screenshots of AT configuration, audio samples). The app supports exporting and importing data so teams can share records or migrate to other systems; it also keeps timestamps and consistent fields so every entry is comparable. Typical workflows include adding weekly lesson notes, logging braille fluency checks, recording technology accommodations and their settings, and producing periodic progress summaries for IEP meetings or parent conferences.

Longitudinal data — repeated, consistently recorded observations over time — is essential when teaching skills like braille, independent technology use, and other vision-specific competencies. These skills develop incrementally and can be highly sensitive to small changes in instruction, tools, or health; a single snapshot can’t show growth, regression, or the effect of an adjustment in teaching strategy or assistive technology. By collecting dated measures and qualitative notes, teams can spot trends, detect plateaus or regressions early, evaluate which interventions work, and provide objective evidence for individualized programming and decision making. StudentDataGUI makes that practical by keeping the historical trail structured and searchable so educators can focus on instruction rather than record-keeping.
