## Overview

TVI Resources is built for teachers who want straightforward, ready-to-use materials for students who are blind or visually impaired. If you're wondering where to find practical classroom aids, sample lessons, tactile graphics, or scripts to generate accessible materials, this site pulls those resources together in one place.

We focus on low-cost, high-impact options: printable templates, 3D-printable tactile objects, step-by-step classroom instructions, and simple computer scripts you can run with minimal setup. The goal is to save you prep time and give you tools that actually work in busy classrooms, not research papers or expensive commercial products.

## Why Open Source Resources?

Open, shared resources make it easier for teachers to adapt, reuse, and improve classroom materials. We know many teachers can't afford specialized commercial equipment, so this collection prioritizes items you can print, build, or repurpose affordably.

When educators share tools and examples, we all benefit — you gain tested ideas you can use tomorrow, and others gain from your real-world feedback. If you try a resource here, please add a short note to its page about how it worked in your classroom (what students liked, what to change). Those short, practical reports help other teachers make quick decisions.

### Free and Open Materials Enhance Accessibility

Adding to accessibility goes beyond just making materials available at low or no cost — it actively lowers barriers and builds capacity: when resources are free and openly licensed, more people can inspect, adapt, translate, localize, and extend them, directly improving quality and utility through real-world contributions. This openness distributes expertise, invites diverse perspectives, and creates a community of shared stewardship. It also shifts development from a “release and done” mindset to an iterative, feedback-driven cycle—materials evolve continuously, stay current with standards and practice, and better reflect the varied contexts and needs of the people they serve.
- **Affordability and equity:** Low-cost options let schools with limited budgets give every student access to needed materials, rather than requiring an individual purchase of expensive specialized tools.
- **Local adaptability:** Open files and step-by-step processes let teachers modify items to match their curriculum, language, or student needs without waiting for a vendor update.
- **Reproducibility:** When we share source files (SVGs, STLs, scripts) and clear build notes, other educators — or local makerspaces and families — can reproduce materials reliably.
- **Transparency and trust:** Open processes show exactly how a resource was made and tested, so teachers can judge fit and safety for their classroom and adapt when necessary.
- **Community-driven improvement:** When teachers share feedback and better versions, the whole collection improves. Small, practical patches (better contrast, different tactile spacing, clarified instructions) often matter more than starting from scratch.
